# SIGNAL-CONSTRUCTION-ST-REVERSAL-LT-REVERSAL
This repository contains code for building a simple trading signal from scratch.

We calculate a weighted and de-meaned short term reversal and long term reversal signal. 

We then evaluate common risk measures for our signals, and calculate factor exposures for our signal.

Using OLS, we extract the residuals from the regression of our signal on the factors, to extract the portion of our signal that is uncorrelated with the factors.
